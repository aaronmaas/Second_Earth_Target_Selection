# Diary 10.04 MPIA

- Met with Melissa Hobson 
	- she is my supervisor 

- Second Earth Project 
	- La Silla Telescope 2.2 Meters 
	- atm [[FEROS]] Spektrograph mounted meters/second precision 
	- Second Earth will have hopefully cm/second 
	- Espresso already has that but there is not much time on espresso 
		- especially we need to observe the stars continuously --> observation programm will be 5 years! 
	- we need to select Targets for the [[Second Earth]] 
		- (bright) G-dwarfs and Early K's
		- Melissa did a pre-Selection with all nearby early Ks and Gs
		- ideal target come with 
			- Bright 
			- nearby
			- G or K 
			- slow roation 
			- quiet in terms of stellar activity 
			- no known hot giant planets --> because migration would have had killed the inner system (I guess)
		- pre selection based on 20 parsec cut. 
		- magnitude-limited sample $$G_{mag} < 8$$
			- lose many ks 
			- add many Gs 
		- Low RMS
		- Low Vsini
		- No signals in RV or activity periodograms
		- Known planets cross-checked with Exoplanet Archive
		- No known hot/warm giants (but hot giants useful for QC!)
		-  Good RV precision
	- Target: 
		- 0.1 m/s 
		- RV precision attainable can be estimated 

- RVs 
	- Periodograms and activity indicators http://www.astro.physik.uni-goettingen.de/research/rvprecision/
	-

- Activity: 
	- Stellar-activity induced RV signals: often ~1 m/s or higher!

- Different Types of RV calibration 
	- Fabri-Perot 
	- [[Iodine Cell technique]] 


- Atmospheric Parameters of the stars 
	- with [[ZASPE]] 

- Physical Parameters like Mass radii and ages
	- with [[Isochrones]]
